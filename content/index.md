Salü everyone!

I am Benjamin, welcome to my page.

This website serves two key purposes:
1. Showcasing my professional work and projects
2. Sharing my thoughts, learnings and ideas through blog posts and articles

The content across this site is written in English. If there's sufficient interest from readers, I'd consider translating content into other languages in the future.
