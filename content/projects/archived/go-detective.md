go-detective ([go-detective on Github](/404)) is a native application that uses Wails to bridge the frontend (HTML, JS, CSS) with the Go backend code, providing a seamless desktop experience. The application leverages Supabase as the Backend-as-a-Service solution, which provides PostgreSQL database capabilities and includes a built-in authentication system.

Key Features:
- Performs critical Know Your Customer (KYC) checks
- Conducts Anti-Money Laundering (AML) screening
- Screens individuals against Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists and international sanctions databases

PEP Lists functionality allows the application to:
- Identify individuals holding prominent public positions
- Flag higher risks for potential corruption or money laundering

The Sanctions Lists component:
- Contains records of individuals and entities
- Tracks those prohibited from certain economic activities
- Maintains data based on international restrictions

Benefits of go-detective include:
- Helping organizations meet regulatory obligations
- Preventing financial crimes
- Combining Go's performance with modern web technologies
- Maintaining native look and feel
- Leveraging Supabase for user management and data persistence
- Providing comprehensive PEP and sanctions screening
