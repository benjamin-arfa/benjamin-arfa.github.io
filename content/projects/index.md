I contribute to a variety of projects that span several key areas including regulatory technology, interoperability standards, and data management tools.

### Active Projects
- [🌐px-reader](/projects/current/px-reader) - A toolkit for parsing statistical data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and converting it to linked data format
- [🐦️pybirdai](/projects/current/pybirdai) - Tools to help democratize and implement the BIRD regulatory reporting standard

### Archived Projects
- [🕵️go-detective](/projects/archived/go-detective) - A native desktop application for AML/KYC checks using sanctions and PEP lists

These projects reflect my interests in:
- Building tools that bridge data standards and formats
- Working with regulatory and compliance requirements
- Creating practical solutions for complex data challenges
- Contributing to open source initiatives
