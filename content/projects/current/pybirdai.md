The `pybirdai` project provides an open source toolkit to facilitate the use of the [Banks' Integrated Reporting Dictionary](https://bird.ecb.europa.eu/) standard for regulatory reporting. BIRD defines standardized reporting rules and templates that European banks use for providing data to supervisory bodies.

Key features:
- GUI toolkit for interacting with BIRD dictionaries and mappings
- Docker containerization for portable deployment
- Tools to validate and transform BIRD models and data
- APIs for seamless integration into reporting workflows
- Documentation and examples for common reporting use cases

The project aims to democratize access to the BIRD standard and make it easier for organizations to:
- Understand reporting requirements through template analysis
- Validate data against BIRD rules
- Transform their data into compliant formats
- Automate regulatory reporting processes

As an [open source project](https://github.com/eclipse-efbt/efbt), pybirdai welcomes contributions to enhance the functionality and usability of the BIRD standard implementation.
