Here are some of my current development projects that I maintain or contribute to:

- px-reader : Application to read and link px-cubes from the bfs website
- pybirdai : Tooling to democratize the use of BIRD as an open standard

Both projects focus on data interoperability and standardization while leveraging container technologies and modern development practices.

Please see below for the links to the related projects.
