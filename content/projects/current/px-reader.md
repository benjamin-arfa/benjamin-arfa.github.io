A Python application ([px-reader on Github](/404)) for parsing and analyzing statistical data with the following key features:

- Parses px-cubes from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS)
- Converts statistical data files to linked data format
- Handles BFS-specific px-format specifications
- Processes cube contents and metadata into standardized linked data

Key outputs and deployment:

- Importable into RDF triple stores like LINDAS (Linked Data Service)
- Accessible via REST API
- Deployable as:
  - Standalone Python service
  - Containerized Docker application

The tool bridges traditional statistical data formats and modern linked data infrastructure, enabling better data integration and interoperability across Swiss government statistics.
