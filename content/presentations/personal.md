Hey there!

It's Benni, over `9*10⁸` seconds old french-german-arab soul based somwhere in the real world.

Music is my jam, software my bread and butter and writing a way of expression which has been accompanying me since my 5. year of high school. I was using different media first (drawing, painting, calligraphy, the good old ones) and then moved on to writing poetry. Nowadays I do feel the need (for both mental health and interest) to write prosody and to dial in once in a while.

I like to comment on topics related to sovereinty, technology and solidarity. Let's see what I will be writing about 😃.
