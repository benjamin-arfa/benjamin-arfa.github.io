Hey there!

I specialize in **data integration**, **governance** and **lifecycle management** across regulatory technologies and healthcare, delivering sustainable **data solutions**. With over 7 years of experience, I've developed deep expertise in implementing **data strategies** and **technical solutions** that drive business value.

In **data strategy** and **architecture**, I focus on comprehensive **lifecycle management** through effective **data modeling** and **technical implementation**. I design robust, business-aligned systems while building **data-driven** organizational capabilities. My technical excellence spans **requirements engineering**, where I bridge communication between business and technical teams, and **software engineering** for scalable data applications. As an active member of **HL7 FHIR-CH**, I contribute to healthcare data standardization efforts.

My professional journey began as a **Data Science Professional** from 2017 to 2020, where I developed **machine learning**-powered applications and implemented cross-industry projects with a focus on practical business solutions. From 2020 to 2022, I served as a **Research Analyst** specializing in **metadata modeling** for banking supervision, **SDMX implementation**, and **cloud application lifecycle management**.

As **Product Owner** for Data & Integration from 2022 to 2024, I led **semantic data integration** initiatives and implemented **master data management** frameworks while contributing to **HL7 Switzerland**. Currently, I work as a Jack of all trades, providing strategic guidance for health sector data initiatives, designing **data architectures**, and developing **system integration** and **interoperability** solutions.

For collaboration or knowledge exchange, feel free to reach out. I'm always interested in connecting with fellow professionals to discuss data challenges and opportunities.
